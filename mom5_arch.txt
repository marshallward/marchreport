MOM 5 architecture update
=========================

MOM 5 performance has been tested on the new Broadwell and Knights Landing
architectures that are now available at NCI.  We compare total runtime and the
main timestep loop for a 10-day simulation of the 0.25Â° global MOM-SIS model.


Broadwell and AVX performance
-----------------------------

We first assess the relative impact of vectorisation.  As a baseline, the
runtimes of the model and its components with vectorisation disabled are shown
below.  The model configuration is 960 cores and we are using Raijin's Sandy
Bridge processors.

We now compare these times to a run with AVX vectorisation enabled, which is
shown below.

If we ignore the variability in initialisation time, which is likely related to
IO and performance of the filesystem, we can see that the model is
approximately 10% faster when AVX instructions are used.  Given that peak
speedup should be closer to 400%, or a factor of four, when all registers are
used, this shows that AVX has a much more marginal impact on model runtime, and
that MOM 5 is currently not well-vectorised.

Our previous report showed that the MOM 5 source code is itself
well-vectorised, with AVX instructions utilised to a very high degree.
However, it would seem that the AVX instructions themselves are not being
effectively leveraged in the model, and that any benefits are blocked by some
other issue, such as poor cacheing or interruptions to the instructions
pipeline.

We next consider the impact of the Broadwell CPUs.  Those results, with AVX
instructions enabled, are shown below.

Again, there is a measureable improvement in the model runtimes, particularly
related to model initialization and sea ice timesteps, which are nearly twice
as fast in most runs.  Ocean runtime is approximately 3% faster, which can
partly be attributed to the slightly faster clock speeds of the Broadwell CPUs
(3.3 vs 3.0 GHz), although the 10% increase in clock speed is greater than the
3% speedup of the model itself.

Additional speedups are observed when the AVX2 and FMA instructions are enabled
in the Broadwell CPUs.  The results are shown below.

This shows additional speedups of approximately 3% in the ocean and sea ice
model, and substantial improvements in model initialisation.


Knights Landing performance
---------------------------

.. TODO Knights Landing introduction: artchitecture, clock speed, AVX512

Sample runs on the new Knights Landing nodes are shown below.

===== ============== ===========    ==========  ===========

If we compare the 960-core runtimes to the Sandy Bridge times, then we see that
the model is approximately 2.6 times slower.  The ocean core itself is
approximately 2.3x slower.  This is consistent with the clock speed difference
of 1.3 GHz in the Knights Landing and 3.0 GHz on the (turbo) Sandy Bridge
processors.  We see that scalability on the Knights Landing nodes is generally
strong, with an approximate 3.8x speedup from 240 to 960 cores, and an
additional 1.5x speedup from 960 to 1920 cores, which matches the scaling
profiles on the Sandy Bridge nodes.

Enabling AVX-512 in MOM 5 produced a segmentation fault on the Sandy Bridge
nodes, which has not yet been investigated.  However, given the relatively
minor impact of AVX on MOM 5 on the Sandy Bridge nodes, we would not
necessarily expect AVX-512 to have a significant impact on runtime performance.

From this, we conclude that the model can be ported to the Knights
Landing architecture without major disruption, and that runtime effectively
matches the clock speed of the processor.  However, additional improvements to
MOM 5 are needed in order to benefit from AVX vectorisation.  In particular,
MOm 5 will need to demonstrate very clear improvements from AVX and AVX-512
vectorisation before it is able to produce performance on the Knights Landing
nodes which is comparable to Raijin.
